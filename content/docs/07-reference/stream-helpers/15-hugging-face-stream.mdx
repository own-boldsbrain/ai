# `HuggingFaceStream`

<Note type="warning">
  HuggingFaceStream is part of the [legacy HuggingFaceS
  integration](/providers/legacy-providers/hugging-face). It is not compatible
  with the AI SDK 3.1 functions.
</Note>

Converts the output from language models hosted on Hugging Face into a ReadableStream.

While HuggingFaceStream is compatible with most Hugging Face language models, the rapidly evolving landscape of models may result in certain new or niche models not being supported. If you encounter a model that isn't supported, we encourage you to open an issue.

To ensure that AI responses are comprised purely of text without any delimiters that could pose issues when rendering in chat or completion modes, we standardize and remove special end-of-response tokens. If your use case requires a different handling of responses, you can fork and modify this stream to meet your specific needs.

Currently, `</s>` and `<|endoftext|>` are recognized as end-of-stream tokens.
