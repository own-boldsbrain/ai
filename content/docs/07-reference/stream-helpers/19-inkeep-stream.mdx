# `InkeepStream`

<Note type="warning">
  InkeepStream is part of the [legacy Inkeep
  integration](/providers/legacy-providers/inkeep). It is not compatible with
  the AI SDK 3.1 functions.
</Note>

The InkeepStream function is a utility that transforms the output from [Inkeep](https://inkeep.com)'s API into a ReadableStream. It uses AIStream under the hood, applying a specific parser for the Inkeep's response data structure.

This works with the official Inkeep API, and it's supported in both Node.js, the Edge Runtime, and browser environments.
